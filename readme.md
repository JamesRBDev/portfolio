## About
My name is James, a resident of Bryan, Texas that has an ever-growing love for all things technology. I also enjoy gaming, gymnastics, and weightlifting.

Since I was nine years old, I have been enamored with modern technology, and have dedicated a significant portion of my life to studying it.

I am now a professional software engineer and web developer, with over ten years of practical experience and multiple certifications.
